    💭 Since emojicode doesn't have the ability to use an escape in a string to setup a custom char. Example: \x1B
    💭 We need to start with a byte and do some memory magic to get it as a string.

    💭 load up escape char(27) as a byte and then store it as a string.
    💧27❗️ ➡️ byte
    ☣️ 🍇 💭 It's a bit of a complex thing to get a string of a byte
      💭 manual memory allocation
      🆕 🧠 🆕 1 ❗ ➡️ uData
      💭 Copy our byte into the memory we alloc'd
      ✍ uData byte 0 1 ❗️
      💭 Get data from our memory pointer
      🆕 📇 🧠 uData 1 ❗️ ➡️ binary
    🍉

    💭 get an optional string from data and unwrap it.
